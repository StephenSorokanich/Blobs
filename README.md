# Blobs

1. objload.py contains all functions for loading/saving .obj files (including textured files).
2. ModObjAnimate.py is the main program for loading a primitive .obj file (sphere, cyl, plane) and modifying it into a blob.
3. Texturer.py does the same as ModObjAnimate.py except with extra texture coordinates.
